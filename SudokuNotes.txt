6/2: Creating dictionaries/hashmaps for rows, columns, and grids
    -before the backtracking process begins, the numpy array of the board will be transformed into 
     dictionaries for constant time access (time spend at the start will be saved later)
    -3 main dictionaries: rows, columns, grids
        -each of the 3 is made up of (here, 9) dictionaries for each thing (row, column, grid)
            -these individual dictionaries store the individual numbers present as key, frequencies as value
    -***NOTE: go back later and take out hard-coded 3 to create general sudoku board***

6/3: Added function to check for breaks using the dictionaries; begin work on recursive solver
    -Current issue: getting "TypeError: argument of type 'int' is not iterable" when trying to check if a given number
     is in row, column, and grid dictionaries 
        -not yet sure how to solve this
